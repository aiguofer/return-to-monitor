return-to-monitor
=================

Gnome-Shell extension to return windows to the right monitor whenever you plug a monitor back in.

To install (will remove a previous version and copy the new files in):

cd /path/to/return-to-monitor
./install.sh

This extension is unmaintained as it is available in Gnome since 3.14: https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=731760
